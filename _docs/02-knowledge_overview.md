The IBMStreams/streamsx.dps toolkit project is an open source Streams toolkit project.

This Streams toolkit allows a simple way for the SPL, C++ and Java operators belonging to a single or multiple applications to share the application specific state information via an external K/V store. It does this via a collection of APIs that can be called from any part of the SPL, C++ and Java operator code.
