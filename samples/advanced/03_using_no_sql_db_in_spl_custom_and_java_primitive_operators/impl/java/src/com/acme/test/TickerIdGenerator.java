==========================================================================================================  
Main purpose of this Java primitive operator is to explain how to use the dps (Distributed Process Store).
The dps functions are all written in C++. That means, we will have to use JNI to dip into those C++ dps
functions from any Java primitive operator's code.

In order to use the dps functions in your own Java primitive operators, you can use this example as a
reference and adopt similar things done here.

1) You have to import the dpsHelper package as done below. This helper package is part of 
   the dps toolkit ($STREAMS_INSTALL/toolkits/com.ibm.streamsx.dps/impl/java/lib/dps-helper.jar). This jar file contains the
   Java dps APIs that the Java primitive operator developers will use. We added that jar file
   to the java build path of the 062_XXXX SPL project. We specifically did that inside the 
   properties of this 062_XXXXX SPL project.
   
   a) You can right click at the top-level 062_XXXXXX project name and select "Properties". In the resulting
   dialog, select "Java Build Path" in the left pane. Now, on the right pane, select the "Libraries" tab.
   There, you may see the dps-helper.jar file. If that full path is either missing or pointing to  a different
   location on your machine, you should remove that existing entry and "Add an External Jar" by
   navigating to your specific $STREAMS_INSTALL/toolkits/com.ibm.streamsx.dps/impl/java/lib directory.

   In addition, you must also do the following:

   This Java primitive operator class is extended from a Streams AbstractOperator and
   in addition it uses a lot of other Streams Java artifacts such as the Tuple class. In order to
   resolve those Streams Java classes and compile it correctly, you have to do the following.
 
      i)   Ensure you are in the Streams Studio.
      ii)  Right click on the 062_XXXXX project and select Properties.
      iii) In the left pane of the resulting dialog, click on "Java Build Path".
      iv)  In the right pane, click on the tab titled "Libraries".
      v)   Click the "Add External Jars" button, add the following Streams jar files from your
           Streams installation directory.
       
           <Your Streams Install Directory>/lib/com.ibm.streams.operator.jar
           <Your Streams Install Directory>/lib/com.ibm.streams.operator.samples.jar
           <Your Streams Install Directory>/ext/lib/commons-math-2.1.jar
                
   b) After adding these three dependent jar files, you may delete/remove the three
      erroneous jar entries in your "Libraries" tab that point to invalid directories.
      
   c) Now, right-click on the 062_XXXXX project and select "Build Active Configurations".

2) Please refer to the <library> sections in the operator model XML file for this Java primitive operator.
   You will notice that there are two of them each with its own libPath element.
   
   a) First <library> section contains a libPath element that points to the 
      impl/java/bin which is part of this project directory. That is where the
      compiled class file for this primitive operator java code is stored.
      
   b) Second <library> section contains a libPath element that points to the 
      the dps-helper.jar file. This typically should point to the jar file inside the
      dps toolkit directory: $STREAMS_INSTALL/toolkits/com.ibm.streamsx.dps/impl/java/lib/dps-helper.jar

3) Since we have to go through a convoluted path of JNI to access the dps functions from Java code,
   it is recommended that you carefully study the nuances of how it is done below.
   This code is documented to a decent extent for helping the developers who are new to the dps toolkit.
   This Java primitive operator example is very comprehensive and gives a good coverage for all the dps APIs.
   You may simply do a case insensitive search for "store" and then follow along the code in this file. 
   
CAUTION
-------
If you are planning to run this Java primitive operator with a memcached or Couchbase back-end server,
you should be aware of the fact that memcached and Couchbase put a limit on the length of the key.
Test case 23 below will attempt to store a key:value pair with a key length exceeding that
allowed limit (240 characters). You will get an exception for test case 23 and 24 while running this
example with memcached or Couchbase. In the case of memcached and Couchbase, please comment out the entire code block for
test cases #23 and #24.

You can happily run all the test cases in this Java primitive operator with other supported K/V stores.
Because, those other K/V stores don't have such a limitation. They allow keys with a size of few kilobytes.

//@Libraries("lib/dps-helper.jar")

// Add the following annotation if you are going to fuse this Java operator with other Java operators that will also use
// the DPS APIs. In that case, it is necessary to add the following annotation so that the fused PE will use a shared class loader.

// same entries in their @Libraries annotation (That rule is from Java and not from Streams). 
// If you don't have this annotation, it will give a runtime exception by trying to load the DPS .so library multiple times

        // For the put operation with TTL option, very first argument is the key, second argument is the value,

        // fifth argument is a string that tell the SPL type name of the value. Exception will be thrown if any error occurs 
        // during the chosen operation. Your key and value can be of any SPL type.
        // (If the TTL value is set to 0, then that K/V pair will not be removed automatically.
        //  Instead, it will stay there forever until the user calls the dpsRemoveTTL API to remove it.)

			// In the case of receiving an exception, you can get the error code and the error message from the StoreFactoryException object.
			// A return with no exception simply means that your HTTP REST API request was sent to the Cloudant server and a response was received from the server.
			// In that case, you will get the HTTP response code in the httpResponseCode method argument you passed. You should interpret the meaning of that HTTP code to 
			// know whether your request really succeeded or not. If the HTTP code indicates "all went well", then the String returned by this API will contain the
			// JSON response string as returned by the Cloudant server for the API you performed.
			//
			// cmdType: Should be 1 if you are executing any of the Cloudant database related APIs.
			//          Should be 2 if you are executing any of the Cloudant document related APIs.
			//
			// httpVerb: Should be one of the supported HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD). [COPY is not a supported verb in this DPS API.]
			// 
			// baseUrl: For the public cloud based Cloudant service, it must be in this format:
			//             http://user:password@user.cloudant.com
			//          For the "Cloudant Local" on-premises infrastructure, it must be in this format:

			//          NOTE: If you give an empty string for the URL, then the Cloudant server configured
			//                in the SPL project directory's etc/no-sql-kv-store-servers.cfg file will be used.
			// 
			// apiEndPoint: It should be a Cloudant DB or document related portion of the URL path as documented in the Cloudant APIs.
			//
			// queryParams: It should be in this format: name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3
			//
			// jsonRequest: This is your JSON request needed by the Cloudant API you are executing. Please ensure that any special
			//              characters such as double quotes are properly escaped using the backslash character.     
			//
			// httpResponseCode:  [It should be an an array of long with a size of 1.]
			//      If this DPS API doesn't throw an exception, then this argument will be set to the HTTP response code returned by the Cloudant server.
			//      You have to interpret the meaning of the returned HTTP response code and make your further logic from there. 
			//

			// In the case of a false return value, you can get the error code from the err argument (See the explanation for err below.)
			// A return value of true simply means that your HTTP REST API request was sent to the HBase server and a response was received from the server.
			// In that case, you will get the HTTP response code in the err argument and you should interpret the meaning of that HTTP code to 
			// know whether your request really succeeded or not. 
			//
			// cmdType: This is not necessary when you use HBase. You can simply set it to 0.
			//
			// httpVerb: Should be one of the supported HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD).
			// 
			// baseUrl: It must be in this format:
			//             http://user:password@HBase-REST-ServerNameOrIPAddress:port
			//          Note: If you give an empty string for the URL, then the HBase server(s) configured

			// 
			// apiEndPoint: It should be the resource portion of the URL path as documented in the HBase REST APIs.
			//
			// queryParams: You may need to set queryParams for scanner APIs. In other cases, you can set it to an empty string.
			//
			// jsonRequest: This is your JSON request needed by the HBase API you are executing. Please ensure that any special
			//              characters such as double quotes are properly escaped using the backslash character.     
			//
			// jsonResponse: This is one of the two mutable variables you must pass to this DPS API.

			//
			// err: 
			//      If this DPS API returns false, then this mutable argument will be set to any DPS or cURL errors that occurred inside the DPS code.
			//      To receive more details about the DPS or cURL errors, you can call the dpsGetLastStoreErrorString() DPS API. 
			//      If this DPS API returns true, then this argument will be set to the HTTP response code returned by the HBase server.
