This application demonstrates how to use the DPS toolkit Java API from a Java operator.

To compile this application from the command line, run the Makefile by typing "make"
Launch by submitting the job to the domain:
streamtool submitjob -d [domain] output/JavaDPSDemo/Distributed/application.JavaDPSDemo.sab

To compile this sample application in Studio, copy the sample to a convenient directory
and import the sample into Studio as existing project. Than right click on the project, and 
choose the "Build Project" command. Then you can launch the resulting SAB file. Open the
Resources/output/JavaDPSDemo/Ditributed folder, right click on "application.JavaDPSDemo.sab"
and select "Launch ..." -> "Launch as Distributed"

NOTE:
If the toolkit is not located in the standard Streams toolkit directory (for example,
because you loaded it from Github), you have to set the environment variable DPS_TOOLKIT_HOME
to point to the directory where the info.xml file of the toolkit is located.
For example enter the command :
export DPS_TOOLKIT_HOME=/myhome/mytoolkits/com.ibm.streamsx.dps
before running the make command.
If this variable is not set the DPS toolkit from the standard Streams toolkit location will be used.

To set this variable from within Streams Studio, do the following :
1) Right click on the project and choose "Configure SPL Build ..."
2) Open the SPL Build -> Environment tab, and click "Add"
3) Add the new variable with the correct location and click the OK button.
